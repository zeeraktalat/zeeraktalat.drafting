  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the various themes and points of connections between the various chapters in this section and outlines the current limitations as well as the major social and technical issues that still need to be addressed in hate speech detection. In particular, the authors discuss the ways in contexts - from legal contexts such as laws determining data collection methods to sociocultural contexts like annotator knowledge - affect the possibilities for the machine learning pipelines. Along with identifying current issues and limitations, the authors delineate future avenues for hate speech detection research.},
