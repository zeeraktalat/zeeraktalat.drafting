# A Guide to Writing Good Reviews

Everyone has to go through the process to learn how to write a good review, as it is a very acquired skill. But, we can make the learning process a little bit easier.
Writing a review is also a hard task because it is not clear who the intended audience of the review is, and how they should action it. In this guide, I'll try to give some advice on what I think makes a good review.

Writing for both is reasonably straightforward. For the people making a decision it is useful when reviewers i nclude a summary of their review at the very top of it. In this summary, provide a sentence or two about what the paper is about, what it contributes, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Then also provide a sentence or two on your position on the paper and its readiness for publication.
