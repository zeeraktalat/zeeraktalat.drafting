# Zeerak Talat

## About

My name is Zeerak Talat  and I'm an academic researcher (who used to go by Zeerak Waseem). 
I work on the intersection between machine learning, science and technology studies, and media studies.
My research seeks to examine how machine learning systems interact with our societies and the downstream effects of introducing machine learning to our society.
I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University, but heading around the world visiting different departments (so get in touch if you wanna host)!
I did my undergrad in Computer Science and the University of Copenhagen, and my master's in IT & Cognition (with [Dirk Hovy](dirkhovy.com)), and recently finished my Ph.D. (with [Kalina Bontcheva](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/kalina-bontcheva)). 
You can find me raising issues with machine learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeerakTalat) and [Mastodon].
I'm always looking for interesting people to work, so do send me an e-mail at zeerak_talat[at]sfu[dot]ca.

## Publications

Google scholar hates name changes so looking for my publications page is not gonna be helpful. This is a large issue that particular affects trans scholars. You can [sign a petition here](https://scholar.hasfailed.us/).
If you want to find citation counts and so on, you can find them on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3M3WdvkAAAAJ).
