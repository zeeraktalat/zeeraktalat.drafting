My name is Zeerak Talat (I used to go by Zeerak Waseem), a Research Fellow at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence and one of the 2024 visiting researcher fellows at [HIIG](https://hiig.de/).
I work on the intersection between machine learning, science and technology studies, and media studies.
My research seeks to examine how machine learning systems interact with our societies and the downstream effects of introducing machine learning to our society.
I did my undergrad in Computer Science and the University of Copenhagen, and my master's in IT & Cognition (with [Dirk Hovy](dirkhovy.com)), and recently finished my Ph.D. (with [Kalina Bontcheva](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/kalina-bontcheva)).
You can find me raising issues with machine learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeerakTalat) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zeerak).
I'm always looking for interesting people to work with, so do send me an e-mail at z[at]zeerak[dot]org.

Google scholar hates name changes so looking for my publications page is not gonna be helpful. This is a large issue that particular affects trans scholars. You can [sign a petition here](https://scholar.hasfailed.us/). If you want to find citation counts and so on, you can find them on my [Semantic Scholar Page](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Zeerak-Talat/2138053020).

<em><strong><font color="red">Announcement:</font></strong> I  will be joining the [Centre for Technomoral Futures](https://www.technomoralfutures.uk) at the [Edinburgh Futures Institute](https://efi.ed.ac.uk) and the [Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at Edinburgh University as a Chancellor's Fellow in Responsible ML and AI in November 2024. I am recruiting students to start in 2025 on topics surrounding hate speech, ethical machine learning, and/or privacy preservation.</em>
